game:
  multiplayer?


evolution requirements:
  self-replication
  blueprint
  inherit blueprint
  Mutation
  selection


simulation settings:
  world-size
  population
  steps/gen
  genome length
  inner neurons


little creatures: (unnamed as-of-now)
  location
  genome
    decides it's neuralnet
    represented by string
  neuralnet brain
  reproduction <-- ADD THIS NOW
    offspring produced from surviving
    genes from parent(s) <- maybe


brain wiring:
  inputs
  outputs
  internal
  connections (wiring)
    genes determine connections and wiring
      ^ improve ^
